Figure out if session-token (made by googleUser.getAuthResponse().id_token) is permanent. 
    If so, use JWT (which has expiry)
        pass user to req.user like currently doing in session-token authorization
    If not, no change. 

Profile page form doesn't send CSRF token, since it's normally a header and forms don't seem to be able to

routes.js/checkAuthenticated creates req.user.email which is going to be JWT's auth.
