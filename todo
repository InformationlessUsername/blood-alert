Check profile.ejs form input client-side before sending to server
    Time to go for bootstrap I guess
        THEREFORE:
Add bootstrap to all EJS files. 

Strip extra req.body data besides form from profile_posts. (So users can't add arbitrary fields to DB.)

Add consoleWarn.js to header. (currently commented out for development)
