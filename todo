For production: 
    Add consoleWarn.js to header. (currently commented out for development)

Check profile.ejs form input client-side before sending to server

Autofill profile.ejs form input using user's DB data. 

Create back end async texting API
    SMS API (maybe at sms.url.com - https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-subdomain)

Add token functionality to profile.ejs form / checker 

Created users that have not added their profile yet should be caught in checker.js

<!-- CURRENT ISSUES WITH CHECKER -->
 Where is textECsAfter in DB? It's not getting there
 need to setTimeout for textECs job and then be able to cancel
 need to hear back from client/user
 need to figure out how I want to do the startTime. Time of reading, maybe!
